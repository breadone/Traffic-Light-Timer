# Traffic Light Timer
traffic light timer for speeches, made with swiftui and actually relatively good practices

# How it works:
Set how much time (min:sec) you want to talk for, ie for a 3 minute speech, you might set 2:50 for green, and :10 for yellow, to signal to yourself to wrap things up.
Once you finish all your time, the timer goes to red and starts to count up, to show you how overtime you went.
